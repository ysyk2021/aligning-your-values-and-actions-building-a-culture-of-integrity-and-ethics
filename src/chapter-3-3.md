Trust, in turn, plays a crucial role in upholding and reinforcing integrity. We will examine how trust enables open communication, collaboration, and ethical decision-making within an organization.

Inevitably, trust may be damaged or broken at some point within an organization. We will discuss techniques for repairing trust and restoring integrity when trust has been compromised. This includes acknowledging mistakes, taking responsibility, implementing corrective actions, and rebuilding relationships through transparent and consistent behavior.

Understanding the relationship between integrity and trust is vital for organizations aiming to build a culture rooted in ethics and principles.
